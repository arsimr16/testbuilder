# testbuilder
This is a project I completed as part of the precourse work for [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). 

I wrote functions to detect the credit card company based on credit card numbers.  (I got a lot of great regular expressions practice for this project!)

I also wrote functions to automate testing for my detection function.  These functions tested all possible patterns for credit card numbers to ensure that my functions were bug free.
